# Mapping_Earthquakes

In this project, we have created an earthquake map with three different views and overlays (earthquakes , major earthquakes, and tectonic plates). The first *Earthquakes* overlay displays the *agnitude* and *location* of the earthquake in the past 7 days, while the second overlay, *Major Earthquakes*, displays earthquakes of 4.5 or higher magnitude. The third overlay, *Tectonic Plates*, allows the user to have a reference of the earthquakes to the tectonic plates.
